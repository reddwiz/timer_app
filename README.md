# First Pre-Release
The app is available for pre-release in the [Releases](https://github.com/rredwiz/timer_app/releases) section of this repository. It includes all of the below-mentioned features, and it is a work-in-progress. It is currently only available for download on Windows, though a Linux version can be made at any time.

# Simple Timer App

This is a simple app that lets you create a configurable desktop timer to suit your needs. 
It's powered by Electron and is one of my first programming projects. 

## Features
* Allows for customizing ultra-specific timing down to seconds.
* Permits looping indefinitely.
* Optional small miniplayer to view the remaining time.
* System tray minimization.
* Custom timer finish sounds (not finished yet).

## Work In Progress

The app isn't finished yet, and I'm working to polish the functionality. 
I might end up rewriting a lot of it from scratch depending on how I feel about it.
I'd appreciate any help or advice!
