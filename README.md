# Simple Timer App

This is a simple app that lets you create a configurable desktop timer to suit your needs. 
It's powered by electron and one of my first programming projects. 

## Features
* Allows for customizing ultra-specific timing down to seconds
* Permits looping indefinitely
* Optional small miniplayer to view the remaining time (wip)
* System tray minimization and background operation
* Custom timer finish sounds (wip)

## Work In Progress

The app isn't finished yet, and I'm working to polish the functionality. 
I might end up rewriting a lot of it from scratch, depends how I feel about it.
I'd appreciate any help or advice!
